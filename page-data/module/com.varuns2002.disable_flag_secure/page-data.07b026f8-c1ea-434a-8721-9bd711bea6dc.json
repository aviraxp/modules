This hardware decryption\nwill push the video directly onto the screen, bypassing any screenshots/screenshare/recording functionality.\n\nOne possible solution is to disable this hardware decryption by installing the Magisk\nmodule [`liboemcrypto.so disabler`](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/liboemcryptodisabler). This will force the\ndevice to not use hardware decryption and in combination with this module will enable screenshots, screen sharing and\nrecording.\n\nInstalling this module might have unintended consequences, such as lowered video quality.\n[Read more](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/magisk-module-liboemcrypto-disabler-for-drm-protected-content-netflix-my5-etc.3794393)\n","summary":"Xposed Module to Disable FLAG_SECURE, enabling screenshots, screen sharing and recording in apps that normally wouldn't allow it.","sourceUrl":"https://github.com/VarunS2002/Xposed-Disable-FLAG_SECURE","hide":false,"additionalAuthors":null,"childGitHubReadme":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h1>Disable-FLAG_SECURE</h1>\n<p>Xposed Module to Disable <code>FLAG_SECURE</code>, enabling screenshots, screen sharing and recording in apps that normally\nwouldn't allow it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Xposed-Modules-Repo/com.varuns2002.disable_flag_secure/total?color=blue\" alt=\"Download-Count\"></p>\n<h2>Usage for LSPosed:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable the module</li>\n<li>Select <code>System Framework</code></li>\n<li>Select the target app in which you want to enable screenshots</li>\n<li>Reboot</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Note:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This app does not prevent apps from detecting that you've taken a screenshot or recorded it like Snap or Instagram.\nThis only enables it in apps that prohibit screenshots and recording.
