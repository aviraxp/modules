Moved project from Eclipse to Android Studio\n2. Updated compile SDK version to use latest SDK (28)\n3. Updated dependencies to use online sources\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install this module you need the following apps and modules installed on your device:\n1. Magisk v18.1 and above - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases\n2. Magisk Manager v7.0.0 and above - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases\n3. Riru Magisk module v16.0 and above - https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru/releases\n4. EdXposed Magisk module v0.3.0.0_beta2 and above - https://github.com/ElderDrivers/EdXposed/releases\n5. EdXposed Installer v2.2.1 and above - https://github.com/solohsu/XposedInstaller/releases\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- Some features are removed on purpose. Since GravityBox has been working on Samsung Oreo devices without much issues, I only implemented features that need special Samsung coding. You can check [GravityBox for Pie](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/app-gravitybox-v9-0-0-beta-1-android-9-t3908768) for additional features.\n- It could take some time to popup the root request, just wait a few minutes until it pops up, usually not much after the xposed installer recognized the module.\n\n## External Libraries\n\nThe project uses the following libraries:\n1. https://github.com/topjohnwu/libsu\n2. https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge\n3. https://github.com/rovo89/XposedMods/tree/master/XposedLibrary\n4. https://github.com/jaredrummler/ColorPicker\n5. Samsung framework libraries which are used for compile only\n\n## Credits\nThis module wouldn't have been here without the following people:\n- [RikkaW](https://github.com/RikkaApps) - Creator of Riru Magisk module, which provides a way to inject codes into zygote process\n- [rovo89](https://github.com/rovo89) - Creator of the original Xposed framework APIs\n- [solohsu](https://github.com/solohsu) and [MlgmXyysd](https://github.com/MlgmXyysd) - Creators of the EdXposed Magisk module and Installer that made all of this possible\n- [C3C0](https://github.com/GravityBox) - Creator of GravityBox Xposed modules, which I learnt a lot from\n- [Wanam](https://github.com/wanam) - Creator of the original XTouchWiz module, which this module is based on.\n- [topjohnwu](https://github.com/topjohnwu) - Creator of Magisk\n- [AbrahamGC](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=7393522) - [For the Extended Power Menu - Pie - Odex framework Smali guide](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=78910083&postcount=944)\n- [jaredrummler](https://github.com/jaredrummler) - For Color Picker library\n\nThis is a moded version of Wanam's XTouchWiz:\nhttps://github.com/wanam/XTouchWiz\n\n## Telegram\nAnnouncements and pre release versions - https://t.me/firefdskit\n","summary":"Firefds Kit Xposed module for Samsung Pie (Android 9) devices","scope":["android","com.android.systemui","com.android.settings","com.samsung.android.email.provider","com.sec.android.app.camera","com.android.nfc","com.samsung.android.MtpApplication","com.sec.android.soagent","com.sec.app.screenrecorder","com.samsung.android.app.smartcapture","com.samsung.android.messaging","com.sec.android.app.launcher","com.samsung.android.contacts","com.samsung.knox.securefolder"],"sourceUrl":"https://github.com/Firefds/FirefdsKit/tree/pie","hide":false,"additionalAuthors":[],"updatedAt":"2021-02-26T01:43:33Z","createdAt":"2021-02-15T16:35:52Z","stargazerCount":1}
