This cannot be restricted and there is no need for this, because only you can take pictures in this scenario, not the app.\n* Some apps will use [OpenSL ES for Android](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/audio/opensl-for-android.html) to record audio, an example is WhatsApp. Xposed cannot hook into native code, so this cannot be prevented.\n* The get applications restriction will not restrict getting information about individual apps for stability and performance reasons.\n* The telephony data restriction will result in apps seeing a fake IMEI. However, this doesn't change the IMEI address of your device.\n* Restricting activity recognition (location) results for recent Google Maps versions and possibly other apps in the error *... java.lang.ClassNotFoundException ...* for unknown reasons.\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nXPrivacyLua is supported on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and later.\nFor Android 4.0.3 KitKat to Android 5.1.1 Lollipop you can use [XPrivacy](https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/blob/master/README.md).\n\nXPrivacyLua was tested with the original Xposed framework only.\n\nHooking *com.google.android.gms.location.ActivityRecognitionResult.extractResult* (restriction *Determine activity*)\nis known to fail with *script:25 vm error: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.google.android.gms.location.DetectedActivity*\nand *script:28 attempt to call nil* for some apps, like Google Maps and NetFlix, for yet unknown reasons.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n* Install [Magisk](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-magisk/)\n* Android 6-7: download, install, and activate [Xposed](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed)\n* Android 8-10: download, install, and activate [EdXposed](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/development/official-edxposed-successor-xposed-t4070199)\n* Android 11: XPrivacyLua mostly works, but is not supported yet.
