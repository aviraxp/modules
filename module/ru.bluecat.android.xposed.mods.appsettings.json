Supporting Android 8.0+\n\n### Discussion/Support: [XDA thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/mod-xposed-app-settings-reborn.4141339)\n\n### Compatibility:\nThe application is tested only on Android 10/11 (Samsung firmware), but has theoretical support for earlier versions of the OS. I do not guarantee work on other firmware. I also note that not all applications will work with all functions.\nIf you do not see errors in edxposed logs from this module, then your firmware requires additional hooks. I cannot provide development for such devices.\n\n### Information:\nUsing the function revoke/restore permissions: select the permissions and click ok + save, reboot, return to the submenu of the target application and click save again, reboot.\n\n### Features:\n- Screenshot control\n- density / dpi\n- font scale\n- fake screen size for resources loading\n- locale (language)\n- fullscreen mode\n- hide title bar\n- keep screen on while app is visible\n- show app above lockscreen\n- disable fullscreen keyboard input\n- Force LTR\n- Auto hide fullscreen (Android 11+)\n- force orientation (portrait/landscape/auto)\n- mute audio (for most apps)\n- insistent notifications (loop the sound / reboot required)\n- force or prevent ongoing notifications (reboot required)\n- mute notifications (reboot required)\n- stay resident in memory (reboot required)\n- force or exclude app from recents (reboot required)\n- access to recent tasks (reboot required)\n- revoke permissions (double reboot required)\n- force using legacy (navbar) menu button (not available on OS 10.0+)\n- notifications priority (not available on OS 8.0+)\n- disable big (expanded) notifications (not available on OS 6.0+)\n","summary":"Fork of the original App Settings by Rovo89.
