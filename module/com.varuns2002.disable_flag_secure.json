If you aren't facing any issues, you can ignore these\ninstructions.\n\nWhen playing DRM encrypted content, most devices will use hardware decryption capabilities. This hardware decryption\nwill push the video directly onto the screen, bypassing any screenshots/screenshare/recording functionality.\n\nOne possible solution is to disable this hardware decryption by installing the Magisk\nmodule [`liboemcrypto.so disabler`](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/liboemcryptodisabler). This will force the\ndevice to not use hardware decryption and in combination with this module will enable screenshots, screen sharing and\nrecording.\n\nInstalling this module might have unintended consequences, such as lowered video quality.\n[Read more](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/magisk-module-liboemcrypto-disabler-for-drm-protected-content-netflix-my5-etc.3794393)\n","summary":"Xposed Module to Disable FLAG_SECURE, enabling screenshots, screen sharing and recording in apps that normally wouldn't allow it.","scope":["android"],"sourceUrl":"https://github.com/VarunS2002/Xposed-Disable-FLAG_SECURE","hide":false,"additionalAuthors":null,"updatedAt":"2021-05-15T20:02:43Z","createdAt":"2021-04-01T17:51:43Z","stargazerCount":2}
