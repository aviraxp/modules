Magisk v19 and above - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases\n2. Magisk Manager v7.5.1 and above - https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases\n3.

LSPosed v0.5.4.0 and above - https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/releases\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- Some features are removed on purpose. Since GravityBox has been working on Samsung Oreo devices without much issues, I only implemented features that need special Samsung coding. You can check [GravityBox for Q](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/app-gravitybox-v10-0-0-beta-1-android-10-t3974497) for additional features.\n- Changes between EdXposed versions 4xxx and 5xxx will result in app settings lost.\n## External Libraries\n\nThe project uses the following libraries:\n1. https://github.com/topjohnwu/libsu\n2. https://github.com/rovo89/XposedBridge\n3. https://github.com/rovo89/XposedMods/tree/master/XposedLibrary\n5.
